Both armies have attack and defense values, the amount of troops lost will be a percentage of the defense value according to the attack value

Example
Army 1 
Attack Value - 1110 (after 10% roll from 1150)
Defense Value - 636 (after 10% roll from 625)
Army 2 
Attack Value - 1070 (after 10% roll from 1150)
Defense Value - 603 (after 10% roll from 625)

as both would lose around 50% of their troops a win condition of the battle has to be defined therefore:
Winner gets 50% of the normal deaths
Loosser gets 100% of the normal deaths

Condition to get 0 troops in a territory
As this system would never work out a 0 troop value Attack value for an Army must be (4)*Army2

Example
Army 1 
Attack value after a few attacks - 600
Army 2
Attack value after a few defenses - 100
as Army 1 has (4)*attack of army 2, army 2 loses all troops and territory goes to army 1

(4) value can be changed
