By the 12th of Febuary we should have a working prototype. We will need to talk on Discord to complete this.

///////////////////////////////NOTES////////////////////////////////////
For the prototype, we will only include one unit; HoloSoldier
There should be databases in the real code, but in this, you can use classes and other implimentations, just to get it to work.
This can be in Python, but try to do it in C++.

//////INTERFACE
(3 seperate types of interface: opening, standard and territory view)
This should have the following:
-turn number
-the map
-territories (1-9) (using the simple map)
-The option to view a territory

--In viewing the territory, the user should have the option to do the following:
-Move
-Attack
-Buy units
-Buy production
-Disband units
